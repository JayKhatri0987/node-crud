This is a Todo application with CRUD operations.Â 
In this Application I am use Node.js (14.14.0) , Mysql (7.3.12) And EJS

For run this application first you add import database. Database name : todoapp

In this application users are Create, Read, Update And Delete Data.
Create : In the create part users are creating Data.
Read : In the read part users are Read the data and Search the Data.
Update: In the update part users are updating the Data.
Delete: In the Delete part users are Delete the Data.

The best part is this application allows the user to delete the data. but we are stored in a database. View parts are dynamically changed.
